Here's a **detailed chapter outline** for a **tutorial plan** on the codebase, designed to guide developers, contributors, or users through understanding, using, extending, and maintaining the system. The structure balances **technical depth**, **progressive learning**, and **practical application**, while aligning with the core abstractions you've provided.

# ðŸ“˜ **Tutorial Plan: Building AI-Powered Codebase Tutorials with PocketFlow**

> **Target Audience**: Developers, technical writers, AI/ML engineers, open-source contributors  
> **Prerequisites**: Basic Python, Git, understanding of LLMs, familiarity with software architecture concepts  
> **Goal**: Enable readers to understand, run, extend, and customize the tutorial generation pipeline

## **Chapter 1: Introduction & Vision**
**Objective**: Set the stage for the project and its value proposition.

- 1.1 What is this project?  
  - AI-generated, pedagogically structured tutorials from any codebase
  - Powered by PocketFlow and LLMs
- 1.2 Why does this matter?  
  - Onboarding new developers faster
  - Automating documentation for complex systems
  - Supporting multilingual and beginner-friendly explanations
- 1.3 Real-world use cases  
  - Open-source onboarding
  - Internal developer training
  - Educational platforms
- 1.4 Key features overview  
  - GitHub/local repo input
  - Abstraction detection
  - Pedagogical ordering
  - Multilingual output
  - Batch & retry support
- 1.5 How this tutorial is structured  
  - From high-level flow â†’ component deep dives â†’ customization â†’ deployment

## **Chapter 2: System Overview & High-Level Architecture**
**Objective**: Introduce the end-to-end flow and how components interact.

- 2.1 The TutorialFlow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)  
  - Visual walkthrough of the workflow
  - Node sequence: `FetchRepo â†’ IdentifyAbstractions â†’ AnalyzeRelationships â†’ OrderChapters â†’ WriteChapters â†’ CombineTutorial`
- 2.2 Data flow via `shared` context  
  - What is `shared`? How is data passed between nodes?
  - Lifecycle of key data structures: `files`, `abstractions`, `relationships`, `chapters`, `chapter_contents`
- 2.3 PocketFlow integration  
  - Why PocketFlow? (Lightweight, composable, batchable)
  - `Node`, `Flow`, `BatchNode` usage patterns
- 2.4 Architecture diagram (with component interactions)
- 2.5 Execution modes: CLI vs. programmatic
- 2.6 Error handling & retry mechanisms

---

## **Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Environment**
**Objective**: Prepare the reader to run and experiment with the system.

- 3.1 Prerequisites & dependencies  
  - Python 3.9+, `pip`, Git
  - Required packages: `requests`, `pathspec`, `PyYAML`, `google-generativeai` / `anthropic`, etc.
- 3.2 Installation & setup  
  - Cloning the repo
  - Installing dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - Setting up virtual environment (recommended)
- 3.3 Configuring LLM providers  
  - Setting API keys for Gemini, Claude, or others
  - Using environment variables or config files
- 3.4 Running the first example  
  - Using `main.py` with a sample GitHub repo
  - Expected output: Markdown tutorial in `/output/`
- 3.5 Verifying the output

## **Chapter 4: Deep Dive â€“ Fetching the Codebase**
**Objective**: Understand how the system ingests and filters source code.

- 4.1 `FetchRepo` Node Overview  
  - Role in the pipeline
  - Inputs: GitHub URL or local path
- 4.2 GitHub vs. Local Mode  
  - `crawl_github_files.py`: cloning, filtering, size limits
  - `crawl_local_files.py`: recursive traversal, `.gitignore` support
- 4.3 File filtering logic  
  - Glob patterns (e.g., `*.py`, `*.js`)
  - Ignoring test files, assets, large binaries
  - Using `pathspec` for `.gitignore`-style rules
- 4.4 Size & memory constraints  
  - Why limit file size?
  - How it prevents OOM errors
- 4.5 Output: List of `(path, content)` tuples  
  - Structure and usage in downstream nodes
- 4.6 Hands-on: Customize filtering rules
