# flow.py - File Summary

**one_line**:  
Orchestrates a sequential workflow to generate a structured tutorial from a codebase using modular nodes.

**Purpose**:  
This file defines and configures a `Flow` (using the PocketFlow framework) that automates the process of analyzing a code repository and generating a coherent, well-structured tutorial. It connects specialized processing steps—from fetching the repo to combining the final tutorial—into a single executable pipeline.

**Major functions/classes**:  
- `create_tutorial_flow()`:  
  The main function that:
  - Instantiates all node classes (processing units) for each stage of tutorial generation.
  - Chains them together in a directed sequence using the `>>` operator (PocketFlow's flow syntax).
  - Returns a `Flow` object starting at `FetchRepo`.

  **Key Nodes Used** (imported from `nodes.py`):
  - `FetchRepo`: Retrieves/clones the target repository.
  - `IdentifyAbstractions`: Discovers key abstractions (e.g., classes, functions, patterns) in the code.
  - `AnalyzeRelationships`: Maps dependencies and interactions between abstractions.
  - `OrderChapters`: Determines a logical narrative order for tutorial chapters.
  - `WriteChapters`: Generates written content for each chapter (*note: this is a `BatchNode`*, implying it processes multiple items in parallel).
  - `CombineTutorial`: Merges individual chapters into a single cohesive tutorial document.

**Key technical details & TODOs**:  
- **PocketFlow Framework**: Uses `Flow` and node chaining (`>>`) to define a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks.
- **Retry Logic**: Most nodes include `max_retries=5, wait=20`, suggesting resilience to transient failures (e.g., API timeouts, LLM rate limits).
- **Batch Processing**: `WriteChapters` is noted as a `BatchNode`, indicating it can process multiple chapters concurrently—likely for performance.
- **Extensibility**: The flow is decoupled from node logic (all in `nodes.py`), making it easy to modify or replace individual steps.
- **TODO (implied)**:  
  - Error handling or fallback logic is not visible here (likely handled in nodes).  
  - No configuration parameters (e.g., repo URL, output format) are passed—these may be injected via node constructors or context.  
  - Consider making the flow configurable (e.g., via arguments) for reuse across projects.

**Short usage example**:  
```python
from flow import create_tutorial_flow

# Create and run the tutorial generation pipeline
flow = create_tutorial_flow()
flow.run()  # Executes the full flow: fetch → analyze → write → combine
```  

> **Note**: The actual input (e.g., repo URL) and output (e.g., tutorial file path) are likely managed within the nodes or via shared context, not visible in this file.
